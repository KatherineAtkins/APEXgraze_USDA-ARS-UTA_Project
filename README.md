# USDA-ARS/UTA-Internship-with-Katy
I am assisting with refining the APEXgraze Model with the USDA-ARS program with mentors Dr. Amanda Nelson and Dr. Mahesh Maskey.
My University of Texas at Arlington research advisor is Dr. Yike Shen.


These scripts focus on pre-processing, post-processing, and data visualization of the APEXgraze model. For more information about the downloading and using APEXgraze, please visit the public repository: https://github.com/mlmaskey/pyAPEXSCU/tree/APEXgraze?tab=readme-ov-file

For any questions, comments, or updates, please contact me at kja7375@mavs.uta.edu
